****Overview:****

This directory contains the game "Two Steps Back",
a project created for CMPT 406 at the
University of Saskatchewan.

In this advanced (second level) game
development course, students were encouraged
to build another game, this time implementing
a more advanced mechanic, as well as creating
a timeline for delivering multiple prototype
stages of the project to receive feedback
for improvements. 

For this project, our group chose to have the
game run on a mobile device so it could make
use of the device's GPS.

Total development time from conceptualization
to release was under 3 months.

****Game Synopsis:****

Title: a play on "One step forward, two steps
back", as well as it referencing it being a
location game.

As a rookie detective, you're sent out on the
seemingly insignificant cases, ones that don't
make the newspaper. With your latest case, you
find yourself at Novis Heights, the local
college campus. Something very sinister seems
to be going on, and it's your responsibility
to put an end to it.

****My Work:****

My primary role in this project was to write
scripts that handled the main character's
inventory, which was used to handle progression
flags at various points throughout the game. As
well, I created the "phone UI" used when
receiving text messages from in-game characters.

In addition to this, I was heavily involved in
debugging others' work, identifying,
communicating and resolving any bugs found, such
as progression flags not triggering properly,
softlocks, being able to repeat sections that
were unintended to be repeatable, and ensuring
visual elements such as text boxes and GUI
elements remained consistant throughout scenes.

****Technical Details****

Game was built using Unity 2018.3.2f1.

An Android build has been included in the
directory.

Should you wish to play it through Unity, note
that some areas require the resolution be
changed to portrait mode, otherwise not all
elements on screen will be viewable and you
will be unable to exit the scene or progress.
